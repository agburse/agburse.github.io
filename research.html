                    Our research focuses on the culture of <em>Spodoptera frugiperda</em> (Sf) cells and the production
                    of recombinant proteins using the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Insect cell lines, including the Sf9 line derived from <em>S. frugiperda</em> ovarian
                    tissue,
                    have become a well-established platform for recombinant protein production at both
                    laboratory and industrial scale. These cells combine ease of handling with the capacity to
                    express complex, post-translationally modified eukaryotic proteins. The BEVS exploits the
                    high infectivity and genetic capacity of baculoviruses, specifically <em>Autographa
                        californica</em> multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV), to introduce and express
                    foreign genes in insect cells. The system enables high-level expression under the control of
                    strong viral promoters and supports the production of a wide range of protein types. Due to
                    its versatility, scalability, and ability to support co-expression of multiple proteins, the
                    BEVS is widely used for the generation of therapeutic proteins, vaccine candidates, viral
                    vectors, and structural biology targets.

                                <p> The multiplicity of infection (MOI) is of central importance for the course of
                                    infection and product yield. An MOI that is too low can lead to incomplete
                                    infection, while an MOI that is too high can result in premature cell death. Precise
                                    quantification of the virus concentration for calculating the MOI is therefore
                                    essential. In this context, mCherry- and GP64-based qPCR, a reliable plaque assay
                                    and a cell size-based assay were established.

                                <p> Efficient transfection and infection are crucial for the production of recombinant
                                    proteins using BEVS. Through the targeted optimisation of these processes – in both
                                    adherent and suspension cultures – virus yield, protein quality, protein yield,
                                    reproducibility and scalability can be significantly improved. A defined virus
                                    addition (MOI) and the correct harvest time can minimise cell stress, promote
                                    synchronous expression and increase protein expression. Precise infection control is
                                    essential for the successful use of the system in research and industry, especially
                                    in large-volume suspension systems.
